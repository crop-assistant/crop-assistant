## Offical Repository of the crop-assistant project ([home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) add-on)
![crop-assistant](https://github.com/crop-assistant/crop-assistant/assets/133213120/913de256-c9c1-4593-800c-8b88420ed48a)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è note that this project is in super early development ‚ö†Ô∏è

### The Idea
build a [home-assistant add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/) allows anyone with a few crops, a home greenhouse or even just a single plant to easily maintain it as automaticly as possible
idealy the system will give the correct amount of resources the plant requires at any time during the year (light, air temperature and humidity, soil moisture, soil nutrients, [...])
we would also like to make the setup process as easy as possible by having a [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) page where you can input the plant types and where each sensor and actuator is placed and connected to

### Roadmap
- [X] build a [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) based system that interfaces a humidity sensor and a pump to [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
- [X] build a basic prototype that uses [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) automations to keep the soil moisture above a certain threshold
- [ ] implement a basic [home-assistant add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/) that has a dummy blank page
- [ ] implement a basic [home-assistant add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/) that lets you choose what plants are present (use a public database, idealy bundle it locally with the add-on)
- [ ] implement a basic [home-assistant add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/) that lets you choose what plants are present (use a public database, idealy bundle it locally with the add-on) and connect sensors and actuators to it
- [ ] expand the roadmap
